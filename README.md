#RPOS

Building a modest and minimalist, but hopefully functionally complete operating system, heavily drawing from the wiki at osdev.org. I'm using this as an opportunity to build, maintain and document a large project.

#Environment Setup

1. follow the instructions in `crosscompiler/`

#Build and Run
1. run `make`
2. run `make boot`
