#RPOS

Building a modest and minimalist, but hopefully functionally complete operating system, heavily drawing from the wiki at osdev.org. I'm using this as an opportunity to build, maintain and document a large project.

#Environment Setup

1. follow the instructions in `crosscompiler/`

#Build and Run

1. run ./clean.sh to remove build artifacts
2. run ./qemu to build and boot in qemu
